  "GROUP BY over a real Arrow file.

  `columnar.group` has its own suite against a source built from literal
  chunks, and that suite is the one that can hand the engine absent or
  over-wide statistics on demand. What it cannot do is show the fold crossing
  boundaries that a **format** decided: record batches whose row counts came
  out of message headers, columns whose buffers were fetched at their own
  offsets, and null counts that came from field nodes rather than from a map
  literal.

  This is also the first place grouping meets a source that records **no
  min/max**, which is the interesting case: a grouped query over Arrow prunes
  nothing on bounds, and the chunk counts say so."
