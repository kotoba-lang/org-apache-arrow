  Every fixture came out of pyarrow (`test/fixtures/generate.py`), and so did
  every expectation: `ground-truth.edn` is emitted by the same script, from
  the files it just wrote. A fixture this repo generated itself would test the
  decoder against its own misunderstanding of the format, and expectations
