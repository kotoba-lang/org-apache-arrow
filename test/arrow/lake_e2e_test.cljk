(ns arrow.lake-e2e-test
  "The whole chain, over a real Arrow IPC file: catalog → authorization →
  triple pattern → buffer range.

  The same test `org-apache-parquet` runs, against the same lake, with the
  format swapped. That is the point of it. `kotobase.lake.reader/register-scan`
  was written with one `:scan` format plugged into it, and until a second one
  arrived, \"the seam is format-agnostic\" was a claim about code that had never
  been asked. **Nothing in `kotobase-lake` changed to accept this file.**

  Two things it inherits for free, and one it does not:

  - the catalog already classified Arrow — `kotobase.lake.sniff` has carried
    the `ARROW1` magic and `application/vnd.apache.arrow.file` since before
    there was a reader for it, because admission never parsed
  - the authorization gate is the same gate, and it stands in front of a real
    file here rather than a fixture stub
  - **pruning is not inherited.** Parquet's run of this test skips two of three
    row groups on footer statistics. Arrow records no bounds, so the identical
    query reads all three, and this test asserts that difference rather than
    hiding it.

  A `.clj` rather than a `.cljc`: JVM-only on purpose, matching the sibling
  repo — the fixture is read with `clojure.java.io`, and the point here is the
  composition rather than a platform conditional."
