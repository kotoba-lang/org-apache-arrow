  "An Arrow IPC file as a `columnar/IColumnSource`.

  A record batch is the chunk. That mapping is the whole adapter, and it is
  worth stating what it cost, because this repo exists to find out: **nothing
  in `columnar` changed to accept it.**

  ## Where Arrow differs from Parquet, and why the seam did not have to bend

  `columnar.source` splits cheap metadata from expensive reads, and Arrow
  honours that split with a strictly smaller cheap side:

  | question | Parquet | Arrow IPC |
  |---|---|---|
  | rows per chunk | footer | batch metadata |
  | nulls per column chunk | footer statistics | `FieldNode.null_count` |
  | min / max per column chunk | footer statistics | **not recorded** |

  So `-chunk-stats` here returns `:rows` and `:nulls` and **no bounds**, and
  the protocol already had a meaning for that: `columnar.stats` documents
  absent min/max as \"the source is not making a claim\", and refuses to prune
  on it. The consequence is visible rather than hidden — an Arrow source
  prunes only all-null chunks, `count` and `count-non-null` still come back
  `{:from :statistics :read 0}`, and `min`/`max` fall through to a scan.

  That is the answer to the question this repo was written to ask. The seam is
  not Parquet-shaped: a format that records less plugs in by reporting less,
  not by growing a special case.

  ## What it did cost

  One thing moved. `IByteSource` lived in `parquet.bytes`, and a second format
  needing the identical protocol made it shared rather than Parquet's, so it
  is now `columnar.bytes` — beside `IColumnSource`, which is the other half of
  the same seam."
