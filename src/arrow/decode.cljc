  "Buffers to values.

  Arrow's flat layouts are the simplest thing a columnar format does: a
  validity bitmap beside a values buffer, with a third offsets buffer for the
  variable-width types. There is no encoding layer and no compression by
  default, which is exactly why this format is the right second one to plug
  into `columnar` — the pressure it puts on the seam comes from a different
  direction than Parquet's pages and dictionaries.

  ## The validity bitmap is LSB-first, and may be absent

  Bit `i` of the mask lives in bit `i mod 8` of byte `i / 8`, counting from
  the **least** significant. A writer that recorded no nulls is allowed to
  emit a zero-length validity buffer, and that means *all valid* — not *all
  null*. Reading it the other way produces a column of nulls from a file with
  no nulls in it, and every aggregate over that column still returns a number.

  ## Refusals name what they refuse

  Body compression and dictionary encoding are refused by name, before any
  buffer is fetched. Both are properties of the buffers and neither touches
  the metadata, so a file this namespace refuses still answers `count`,
  `count-non-null` and all-null pruning out of `arrow.ipc/batch-header`."

(defn decompress-buffer
  "One body buffer, undone if the batch declared a compression.

  Arrow compresses **per buffer**, not per body, and prefixes each with an
  int64 little-endian uncompressed length. Two cases that are easy to miss and
  silent when missed:

  - **A length of -1 means the buffer is stored RAW.** Writers emit this when
    compressing would have made the buffer bigger, so it is the normal state
    for small buffers -- a validity bitmap of one byte, an offsets buffer of a
    handful of entries -- and a decoder that always decompresses fails on
    exactly the files that compress well.
  - **A zero-length buffer carries no prefix at all** and stays empty. Reading
    8 bytes of length from it would consume the next buffer's bytes."
