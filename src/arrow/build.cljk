  "A FlatBuffers **builder**. The inverse of `arrow.flatbuffers`, and much the
  harder direction.

  ## Why the buffer is built backwards

  A FlatBuffers table stores its fields at positive offsets from itself and
  points at its vtable with a *negative* one, and a vector stores its length
  before its elements. Both mean a writer must know how big a thing is before
  it can write the thing that refers to it. The format resolves this by
  building from the **end of the buffer toward the front**: every object is
  complete before anything referring to it is written, so a reference is
  always backwards into finished bytes.

  So the working representation here is a vector accumulated in **reverse** —
  index 0 is the final byte of the finished buffer — and `offset` is the
  distance from the end rather than a position. `finish!` reverses it once.
  Two consequences worth stating, because both are silent when wrong:

  - a little-endian value is pushed **most-significant byte first**, since the
    accumulation is reversed
  - patching a value already written at offset `o` touches reverse-indices
    `o-1, o-2, …`, which is what `place-at!` exists to get right in one place

  ## Alignment is not decoration

  `prep!` pads so a value of `size` bytes lands on a `size` boundary *counting
  from the end*, including the bytes about to be written after it
  (`additional`). Getting this wrong produces a buffer that this repo's own
  reader still reads — the offsets are all self-consistent — and that a real
  Arrow implementation rejects or misreads. That asymmetry is why the tests
  hand the output to pyarrow rather than only round-tripping it.

  Scope: exactly what Arrow's metadata uses — tables, scalars, strings,
  vectors of offsets, vectors of inline structs, and unions (which are just a
  type byte plus an offset). No nested vectors of vectors, no shared strings."
