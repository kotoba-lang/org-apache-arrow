  "FlatBuffers access — the encoding Arrow writes its metadata in.

  Its own namespace for the same reason `parquet.thrift` is: this is a
  self-contained byte grammar with nothing to do with columns, and keeping it
  separate is what lets it be tested against byte sequences from the
  FlatBuffers spec rather than against this repo's idea of an Arrow file.

  ## Why this is a reader and not a generated binding

  The usual way to consume FlatBuffers is to run `flatc` over the schema and
  compile the output. That would put a generated-code step, a toolchain, and a
  language target between this library and its input — for a format whose
  access pattern is four arithmetic operations. Arrow's metadata uses tables,
  structs, strings, vectors and unions and nothing else, so the whole grammar
  is the hundred lines below.

  ## The one thing that is easy to get backwards

  A table's first field is a **signed** offset that is SUBTRACTED to find the
  vtable, while every other offset in the format is unsigned and ADDED. Both
  are int32 at a position, so a decoder that reads them the same way works on
  every buffer it is first tested against — vtables are usually emitted after
  the tables that point at them, making the soffset positive — and then fails
  on a buffer where the writer shared a vtable backwards. It is spelled out in
  `table-vtable` rather than left as a subtraction to notice.

  ## Absent is not zero

  A field whose vtable slot is 0, or whose id is past the end of the vtable,
  is **absent**, and absent means the schema's default rather than the value
  0. `field-offset` returns nil for both cases so a caller has to decide;
  every reader here that has a default states it at the call site."

  The same rule `parquet.thrift/le-uint` states, and for the same reason: the

  value past double precision and returns a quietly rounded answer, on the JVM
  as well as in ClojureScript. So the JVM path is exact integer arithmetic
  (where `bit-shift-left` on a long wraps to a negative for a value with the
  high bit set, which is the correct signed answer), and the ClojureScript
  path REFUSES a magnitude it cannot represent rather than rounding it.

  A reader that returns a plausible wrong number is worse than one that says
  it cannot represent this value, because nothing downstream can tell."
